# Astar-quagent
This is my solution to a project for my artificial intelligence course. It uses a java API into the quake engine to
get a "quagent" to walk the shortest path between itself and data at a known position. The room has obstacles and 
it's dimensions are known before hand to be used by A* to calculate the shortest path.
